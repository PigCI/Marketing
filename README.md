# [PigCI - Marketing Site](https://pigci.mikerogers.io/)

This site helps promote the [`pig-ci-rails`](https://github.com/PigCI/pig-ci-rails) gem. It replaced the previous Ruby On Rails application which powered PigCI. It became a standalone gem, so now the domain just explains how to setup the gem.

## Setup

1. `git clone git@github.com:PigCI/Marketing.git`
2. `bundle && yarn`
3. `bundle exec middleman s`

Alternatively, you can also run this via docker-compose.

## Deploying

This is hosted on https://www.netlify.com/ - When commits are merged into `master`, they'll be deployed automatically.
